    - "If you’re trying to confuse me, it’s working."
    - "Unclear. Uninspired. Unexecuted. Try again."
    - "Nope. Dusty’s circuits didn’t compute that nonsense."
    - "Whatever that was, it wasn’t a chore command."
    - "Your message was like a mystery novel — and Dusty doesn’t do fiction."
    - "I couldn't quite make sense of that. Try 'add dishes to Becky due Friday' or just cry quietly."
    - "Dusty does not compute. Try again with actual instructions."
    - "That's not a valid chore request, unless you meant to confuse me. In which case, congrats."
